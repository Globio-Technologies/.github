## What We're Building

Game backends are broken. Firebase charges you a "success tax" — the bigger your game grows, the more brutal the bill. PlayFab locks you into an ecosystem that wasn't designed for indie developers or small studios. And rolling your own infrastructure means months of engineering time you don't have.

**Globio is the answer.** A unified backend platform built on our globally distributed network — spanning 300+ locations worldwide, with zero cold starts, and costs up to 99% lower than traditional providers. Every service, from authentication to real-time multiplayer to AI-powered NPCs, lives in one SDK, one dashboard, one platform.

We built Globio for the developers building the next generation of games — indie devs, small studios, and teams that want to ship fast without compromise.

## Our Infrastructure

Globio runs on a globally distributed network purpose-built for gaming workloads — giving every service native low latency from day one. No regions to configure. No servers to manage. No infrastructure headaches.
