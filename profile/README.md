## What We're Building

Game backends are broken. Firebase charges you a "success tax" — the bigger your game grows, the more brutal the bill. PlayFab locks you into an ecosystem that wasn't designed for indie developers or small studios. And rolling your own infrastructure means months of engineering time you don't have.

**Globio is the answer.** A unified backend platform built entirely on edge infrastructure — globally distributed across 300+ locations, with zero cold starts, and costs up to 99% lower than traditional providers. Every service, from authentication to real-time multiplayer to AI-powered NPCs, lives in one SDK, one dashboard, one platform.

We built Globio for the developers building the next generation of games — indie devs, small studios, and teams that want to ship fast without compromise.

## Our Stack

Globio is built on top of the Cloudflare edge stack — Workers, R2, D1, and Durable Objects — giving every service native global distribution from day one. No regions to configure. No servers to manage. No infrastructure headaches.
